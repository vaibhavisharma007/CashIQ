            <h3>Myth: Real estate is always the best investment.</h3>
            <p>
                Fact: Real estate can be a good investment, but it depends on various factors such as location, market conditions, and your financial goals. It's essential to diversify your investment portfolio and not rely solely on real estate.

            <h3>Myth: You need a lot of money to start investing.</h3>
            <p>
                Fact: Many investment platforms allow you to start with a small amount of money. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market conditions.

            <h3>Myth: You can't lose money in the stock market.</h3>
            <p>
                Fact: All investments come with risks, and the stock market is no exception. It's essential to do your research and invest in companies that you believe in, rather than trying to time the market.

            <h3>Myth: You should sell all your stocks during a market crash.</h3>
            <p>
                Fact: Market crashes are a normal part of the investment cycle. Instead of selling your stocks, you may want to consider buying more at a lower price, as long as you have a long-term investment strategy.
